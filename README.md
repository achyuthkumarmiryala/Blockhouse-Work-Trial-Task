# Quantitative Analysis of Temporary Market Impact

This repository contains the full analysis and report for the Blockhouse Work Trial Task. The project focuses on empirically modeling the temporary price impact of market orders and formulating a rigorous mathematical framework for optimal trade execution.

## 📋 Project Summary

This project uses high-frequency, ten-level limit order book data for three equities (**FROG**, **SOUN**, and **CRWV**) to solve a classic optimal execution problem. The analysis is divided into two core parts:

1.  **Empirical Impact Modeling**: A data-driven approach was taken to model the temporary impact function, `gₜ(x)`. By simulating thousands of market orders against real order book data, a clear relationship between trade size and execution cost (slippage) was established. Different mathematical models (Linear, Square-Root, Power-Law) were fitted and evaluated to find the most accurate representation of this relationship.

2.  **Optimal Execution Framework**: Based on the empirically derived impact model, a mathematical framework was formulated to determine the optimal strategy for executing a large order over a series of smaller trades.

## 📊 Key Results & Conclusions

The analysis yielded two primary conclusions that form the foundation of this project:

1.  **Market Impact is Predominantly Linear**: The analysis overwhelmingly shows that a **Linear model (`g(x) = βx + α`)** provides the most accurate and parsimonious fit for the data. In nearly all tested scenarios, this model achieved the highest R² value (often >0.98), confirming that for the order sizes analyzed, the slippage cost increases in a simple, linear fashion.

2.  **TWAP is an Optimal Execution Strategy**: A key insight from the linear impact model is that the total execution cost simplifies to **`J(x) = βS + Nα`**. This means the cost is independent of the trading schedule. Therefore, a straightforward **Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)** strategy is an optimal solution from a pure cost perspective.

## 📁 Repository Contents

This repository is structured to provide a complete and transparent overview of the work performed:

* **`Blockhouse_Impact_Analysis.ipynb`**: The primary Jupyter Notebook containing all Python code, from data loading and simulation to model fitting and visualization.
* **`Achyuth_Kumar_Miryala_Blockhouse_Work_Trial_Report.pdf`**: The formal 2-page report that summarizes the methodology, findings, and mathematical framework.
* **`*.png` files**: A full set of plots generated by the notebook, visualizing the average impact curves and model fits for each ticker.
* **`*_impact_results.csv`**: The raw slippage data generated from the market impact simulations.

## 🚀 Replicating the Analysis

To run the analysis yourself, please follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and the required libraries installed.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
    ```
2.  **Data**: Place the original data files (`FROG_*.csv`, `SOUN_*.csv`, `CRWV_*.csv`) in the same directory as the notebook.
3.  **Execute Notebook**: Open and run the `Blockhouse_Impact_Analysis.ipynb` notebook from top to bottom. The notebook will regenerate all the analysis plots and result CSVs.
